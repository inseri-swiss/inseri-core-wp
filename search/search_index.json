These blocks are not isolated elements but they can receive input from and give output to other blocks. A typical example would start with a text block containing the configuration for a dropdown. Selecting one option in the dropdown would provide an API block with the parameters to query data from an external source. Using a Python block, the response could then be transformed into a format which a block for graphs can display.</p> <p>inseri name comes from the Latin insero which means to sow, to plant but also to insert.</p> <ul> <li>More information about the project can be found at here.</li> <li>For examples and showcases see here.</li> <li>Detailed documentation is available at inseri-swiss.github.io/inseri-core-wp.</li> <li>Try out our Playground.</li> <li>For Ideas and Questions please use GitHub Discussions.</li> <li>Bug and Issue reports are welcome on GitHub Issues.</li> <li>The development takes place on GitHub.</li> </ul> <p>Do you want to get regular notifications?
