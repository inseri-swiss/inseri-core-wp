inseri core provides interactive and executable blocks. The blocks have names, which are integrated with the [WordPress List View](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/){:target="\_blank"}, and are not isolated but they can receive input from and give output to compatible blocks.

If you want to see their feature in practice please see the [inseri core blocks](https://inseri.swiss/showcase/#core-blocks){:target="\_blank"} on inseri.swiss.

## Use cases

- Interactive online tool via **interactive online components** with all inseri blocks, e.g. [Plotly Chart](./plotly.md), [Dropdown](./dropdown.md)
- Data reuse and integration of: **local user data** with the [Media Collection](./mediaCollection.md) and [Local File Import](./localFileImport.md) blocks, and **data interfaces** with [Zenodo Repository](./zenodo.md) and [Web API](./webApi.md) blocks
- Data analysis and simulation via **compute interfaces** with [Python Code](./python.md), [R Code](./rCode.md), [JavaScript Code](./javascript.md), [Web API](./webApi.md) blocks
