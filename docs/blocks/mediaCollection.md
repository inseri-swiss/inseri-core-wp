# Media Collection

User can select multiple files from media library. Upon selection of a single file, the block will load the file and emit its content as an output.

If you already uploaded your desired file, you can choose it from the _Media Library_, otherwise you can _upload_ it after adding the block.

## Output

## Parameters

### Label

### Show block

## Extended view

In the Media Library, you can organize your files that will be available for re-use in your posts.

### Metadata

Alt text: Alternative text for images.

Title: Label for the file. The default value is derived from the original file value.

Caption: Text to be shown below images.
