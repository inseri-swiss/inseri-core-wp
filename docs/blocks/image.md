# Image

The image viewer can show images from a remote source.

## Input

It expects an image URL as input through a channel in the post (e.g. from a text editor or a Python block).

## Parameters:

### Caption

Set a caption that will appear below the image.

### Alt text

The alternative text is used for accessibility or if the image does not load.

### Height

Adjust the height of the image in pixels.

### Resizing behavior

If the width and height of the block have a different ratio than the image, different view modes are available.
