# Text Editor

The Text Editor can be used to define values of a couple of text-based formats that can be chosen from the dropdown. This selection will be used for validation of the content and for controlling the type of data shared between blocks.

## Output

The content of the block.

## Formats

JSON, XML, Text, HTML, CSV, Markdown, SVG, Python, R, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, YAML

## Parameters

### Label

Text above the editor

### Show block

The block can be hidden from readers but its content is still available as input for other blocks.

### Publicly editable

Visitors of the page can play with the content. This can be useful in combination with Python scripts that do any standardized calculation on custom input.
