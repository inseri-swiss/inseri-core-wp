# Text Editor

namespace: `inseri-core/text-editor`

The Text Editor can be used to define values of a couple of text-based formats that can be chosen from the dropdown. This selection will be used for validation of the content and for controlling the type of data shared between blocks.

Editor's output will be user-entered content.

## Formats

JSON, XML, Text, HTML, CSV, Markdown, SVG, Python, R, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, YAML

## Parameters

### Label

Text above the editor

### Show block

The text editor block can be hidden from readers but its content is still available as input for other blocks.

### Publicly editable

Visitors of the page can play with the content. This can be useful in combination with Python scripts that do any standardized calculation on custom input.
