# Python Code

The python code block can be used with its own code or code loaded from another source as a text editor with the type `Python`.

This block allows multiple inputs and outputs. This makes it interesting to tie the behaviors of different blocks together.

To set the inputs and outputs for the script, select "open extended view" which opens a popup.

## Extended view

Imagine we have the following Python script:

```python
sum = a + b
product = a * b
```

You can see that `a` and `b` are not defined in this script.
On the top right you can set the inputs. Enter the variable name `a` and accept it with the `+` button. You can now choose any channel from your post. Repeat this with `b`. Input variables can be deleted with `x` next to the import.

Outputs can be defined on the bottom left. Enter `sum` into the text field and accept ith with `+`. Now, choose a content type. For simple values as arrays or numbers, `JSON` is the best option.
Like inputs, output variables can be deleted with `x`.

## Parameters

### Label

Add a description above the code block.

### Show block

Show or hide the code.

### Execute automatically

The script will run automatically on load and any input change. If set to false, the script will have to be run explicitly.

### Publicly editable

Python blocks can be set to publicly editable. This may be interesting if you want to show calculations depending on certain parameters.
After a page reload the changes in the code will be lost.
