# inseri Data Flow

inseri Data Flow is available near the configuration panel and provides a overview of the inseri blocks available in a given page or post and the dependencies between the blocks via a corresponding directed acyclic graph (DAG).

The Blocks section provides all inseri compatible blocks, and the Charts section provides an overview where the nodes are represented by nodes and the edges are the data. There are several actions that the use can perform:

- by selecting a block from the **Blocks** section, the corresponding node from the Chart section is selected (the color changes from grey to blue). Moreover, the block is highlighted also in the working area.
- by hovering any of the nodes from the **Chart** section, the corresponding block from the Blocks section is highlighted.
- by selecting any of the nodes from the **Chart** section, the corresponding block from the Blocks section is selected. Moreover, the block is highlighted also in the working area.

By clicking on the icon before Chart, a popup with the DAG is displayed where the name of the blocks is displayed. By using "Show Details" (top right) a more complex diagram is displayed where one see exactly which data from a given block is used.
