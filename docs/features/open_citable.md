# Open and Citable

inseri is designed to enable open and citable content

- open: by using the [Export Block](../blocks/export.md) one can allow any visitor to download the page in a reusable format,
- citable: by depositing the previously generated content to a data repository, e.g. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/){:target="\_blank"}, it is possible to have a better longevity but to obtain also a persistent identifier (PID) that makes the content citable. Please see [How to: Deposit Content](../how-to/deposit_content.md).
