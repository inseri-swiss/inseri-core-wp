## Plotly or Matplotlib?

inseri supports both Plotly and Matplotlib. Which one you want to use is first of all a matter of taste.

There are some differences: Matplotlib works with files which means it can be combined with a download block to reuse the result.
Plotly offers more interactive options than a static image would.
