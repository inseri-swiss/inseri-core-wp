# Playground

[inseri Playground](https://zi.uzh.ch/whp/science-it/inseri/playground/){:target="\_blank"} relies on [WordPress Playground](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/){:target="\_blank"} to provide a playground where you can try out our [inseri core](https://wordpress.org/plugins/inseri-core/){:target="\_blank"} plugin and explore (inspect and even edit) all our [showcases](https://zi.uzh.ch/whp/science-it/inseri/showcase/){:target="\_blank"}.

Be aware that your changes in the playground are temporary and will be gone after a page refresh.
