**Scientific and Interactive Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress to facilitate Open Science**

[inseri core](https://wordpress.org/plugins/inseri-core/){:target="\_blank"} is a WordPress plugin developed as part of inseri.swiss swissuniversities project â€“ Programme Open Science I (2021-2024).

inseri core introduces scientific and interactive Gutenberg blocks to facilitate open science.

It uses special blocks to make content created on WordPress interactive.
These blocks are not isolated elements but they can receive input from and give output to other blocks.
A typical example would start with a text block containing the configuration for a dropdown.
Selecting one option in the dropdown would provide an API block with the parameters to query data from an external source.
Using a Python block, the response could then be transformed into a format which a block for graphs can display.

inseri name comes from the Latin _insero_ which means **to sow, to plant** but also **to insert**.
