# inseri

## Introduction

inseri uses special blocks to make content created on WordPress interactive.
These blocks are not isolated elements but they can receive input from and give output to other blocks.
A typical example would start with a text block containing the configuration for a dropdown.
Selecting one option in the dropdown would provide an API block with the parameters to query data from an external source.
Using a Python block, the response could then be transformed into a format which a block for graphs can display.
