Scientific and Interactive Gutenberg Blocks to facilitate Open Science

== Description ==

The main focus of inseri.swiss is to provide tools for scientific publications and to promote Open Access, in other words, to eliminate technical barriers and provide reproducibility. As a result, the inseri core provides special blocks that enable to share data between blocks.

## Blocks:
- **[Download Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/download/)**: It gives guests the possibility to download data from other blocks.
- **[Dropdown Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/dropdown/)**: It provides guests options to choose from and the selected option can be reused in other blocks.
- **[HTML Code Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/html/)**: It renders HTML code using the other block's data.
- **[Image Box Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/image/)**: It displays an image utilizing the data of another block.
- **[Local File Import Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/localFileImport/)**: It allows guests to provide their own data for blocks.
- **[Media Collection Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/mediaCollection/)**: A collection of media files is made available as data for other blocks.
- **[Plotly Chart Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/plotly/)**: It visualizes the data of another block using Plotly.
- **[Python Code Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/python/)**: Guests can execute Python code with data from other blocks and the result of the execution is made available to other blocks.
- **[Text Editor Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/textEditor/)**: It allows to share text content like JSON or XML with other blocks.
- **[Text Viewer Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/textViewer/)**: It displays text content like JSON or XML from other block.
- **[Web API Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/webApi/)**: It enables to call web API and to share this data with other blocks.
- **[Zenodo Repository Block](https://docs.inseri.swiss/blocks/zenodo/)**: Using a DOI, a dataset can be loaded from Zenodo.org and shared with other blocks.

Detailed documentation is available at [docs.inseri.swiss](https://docs.inseri.swiss/).
